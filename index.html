        <h5 class="display-5">What is it?</h3>
        <p>"Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet. Even copying and pasting the lyrics of your
        favorite song is a form of web scraping! However, the words “web scraping” usually refer to a process that involves
        automation. Some websites don’t like it when automatic scrapers gather their data, while others don’t mind.<br>
        If you’re scraping a page respectfully for educational purposes, then you’re unlikely to have any problems. Still, it’s
        a good idea to do some research on your own and make sure that you’re not violating any Terms of Service before you
        start a large-scale project."</p>
